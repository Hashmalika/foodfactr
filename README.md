FoodFactr â€“ Full-Stack Health &amp; Nutrition Tracker


FoodFactr is a full-stack web application designed to help users monitor their diet, exercise routines, and overall health habits. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend, and a modular HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, the app provides a smooth, responsive, and personalized health tracking experience.

Key features include:

* Barcode scanner using Quagga.js to identify packaged food items

* Meal planning with nutritional breakdown (calories, protein, carbs, fat)

* Exercise diary with cardio/strength logging, calorie burn estimates, and notes

* Profile section to customize dietary goals and preferences

* Nutrition tracker for daily and weekly progress visualization

* Product lookup from a MongoDB-based food database

* Recipe book with API-powered recipe search and smart shopping list

* LocalStorage integration for offline persistence and quick access

The project follows a modular folder structure with dedicated sections (dashboard, profile, meals, exercise, recipes, etc.) and clean UI design following a green health theme for clarity and engagement.

This project combines frontend UX design, API integration, and backend database management to deliver a complete wellness tracking solution.
